            <h3 class="article__section-title">At the Origins of Nervous System Calculus</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                One of the most unknown and fascinating facets of Ada Lovelace lies in her obsession with what she called the "calculus of the nervous system". This intellectual quest, documented in her private correspondence and personal notes, reveals a thought of stunning modernity. Ada sought to establish a mathematical bridge between the mechanisms of the analytical engine and the functioning of the human brain, anticipating the theoretical foundations of computational neuroscience.
            </p>
            <p class="article__content">
                As early as the 1840s, Ada Lovelace expressed in her letters the conviction that nervous processes follow precise mathematical laws. She writes to her mother that she wishes to develop a "science of the nervous system" based on the same principles as those governing the analytical engine. This ambition testifies to a remarkable holistic vision, seeking to unify mechanical computation and biological processes in a coherent theoretical framework.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">Towards a Mathematical and Electrical Biology</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                Ada's approach was not limited to the brain. She was interested in metabolism, blood circulation and "vital operations" in general. She imagined that these processes could be formalized mathematically, a revolutionary idea at a time when biology remained largely descriptive. Her intuition prefigured modern systems biology, which effectively models metabolic networks and cellular signaling cascades using differential equations and algorithms.
            </p>
            <p class="article__content">
                Ada maintained correspondence with Michael Faraday, pioneer of electromagnetism. Faraday's discoveries about electricity fascinated Ada, who saw in them potentially the physical substrate of nervous operations. Long before the discovery of neuronal action potential by Luigi Galvani and Emil du Bois-Reymond, she sensed that electricity played a crucial role in nervous functioning. This intuition led her to imagine parallels between electrical circuits and nervous circuits.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">A Unified Vision of Mind and Life</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                What distinguishes Ada Lovelace's approach is her refusal to separate mind and matter, calculation and life. She rejected the Cartesian dualism dominant in her era to propose an integrated vision where thought, calculation and biological processes participated in the same mathematical reality. This monistic perspective anticipated contemporary debates in philosophy of mind and cognitive science on the computational nature of consciousness.
            </p>
            <p class="article__content">
                The mathematical and experimental tools of the Victorian era obviously did not allow the realization of Ada's ambitious program. The nervous cell theory would only emerge with Ramon y Cajal in the 1890s. The biochemical understanding of neurotransmitters would wait until the mid-20th century. Ada was working with brilliant intuitions but without the means to validate them empirically.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">Ada Lovelace's Dream Realized by Neuroscience</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                Today, computational neuroscience partially realizes Ada Lovelace's dream. Mathematical models describe the electrical properties of neurons, neural network dynamics, and even certain aspects of cognition. Brain-machine interfaces establish direct bridges between biological computation and artificial computation. The "calculus of the nervous system" that Ada called for now constitutes a flourishing scientific field.
            </p>
            <p class="article__content">
                Ada Lovelace's quest for a calculus of the nervous system illustrates the power of theoretical intuition in science. Sometimes, great ideas precede by far the technical capabilities necessary for their realization, patiently waiting for history to catch up with them.
