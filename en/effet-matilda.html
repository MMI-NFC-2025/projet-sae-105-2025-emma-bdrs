            <h3 class="article__section-title">The Matilda Effect</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                The history of science is marked by female contributions that have been systematically minimized or even completely erased. This phenomenon, named the "Matilda effect" by historian Margaret Rossiter in 1993, takes its name from suffragette Matilda Joslyn Gage who denounced this systemic injustice as early as the 19th century.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">An Emblematic Victim of Invisibilization</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                Ada Lovelace perfectly illustrates this process of invisibilization, her work having long been attributed to Charles Babbage or considered negligible. The Matilda effect designates the recurring denial or minimization of women scientists' contributions in favor of their male colleagues.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">A System of Persistent Prejudices</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                This mechanism manifests itself in multiple ways: attribution of work to a male collaborator, undervaluation of the importance of discoveries, or simple omission in historical narratives. This phenomenon does not result from isolated oversights but from a system of deeply rooted prejudices.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">A Belated Recognition</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                For more than a century after her death in 1852, Ada Lovelace's contributions were systematically questioned. Some historians suggested that Babbage had written her famous notes, others minimized the scope of her work. It took until the 1950s and the development of computing for her genius to finally be recognized.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">Female Figures Still Eclipsed</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                Even today, debates persist about the real extent of female contributions, a questioning rarely applied with such vehemence to male scientists. Rosalind Franklin, whose crystallographic work was essential to the discovery of DNA structure, never received the Nobel Prize awarded to Watson, Crick and Wilkins. Lise Meitner, physicist who participated in the discovery of nuclear fission, was excluded from the Nobel Prize awarded to her collaborator Otto Hahn. Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered pulsars but saw her thesis director receive the Nobel Prize alone. The list is sadly long.

            <h3 class="article__section-title">Restoring the Memory of Forgotten Pioneers</h3>
            <p class="article__content">
                Recognition of the Matilda effect represents a crucial step towards greater scientific equity. Initiatives such as Ada Lovelace Day, celebrated every year in October, aim to highlight female contributions in science and technology. Historical rewriting projects, exhibitions and educational programs work to restore the memory of these forgotten pioneers.
